#pragma  mark * MSClient Public Interface


// The |MSClient| class is the starting point for working with a Windows Azure
// Mobile Service on a client device. An instance of the |MSClient| class is
// created with a URL pointing to a Windows Azure Mobile Service. The |MSClient|
// allows the developer to get |MSTable| instances, which are used to work with
// the data of the Windows Azure Mobile Service, as well as login and logout an
// end user.

// The application key for the Windows Azure Mobile Service associated with
// the client if one was provided in the creation of the client and nil
// otherwise. If non-nil, the application key will be included in all requests
// made to the Windows Azure Mobile Service, allowing the client to perform
// all actions on the windows Azure Mobile Service that require application-key
// level permissions.
