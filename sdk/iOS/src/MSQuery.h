#pragma mark * MSQuery Public Interface


// The |MSQuery| class represents a query that can be configured and then
// executed against a table of a Windows Azure Mobile Service. The query is
// serialized as a query string in the URL of the request. A query can be
// configured and then sent to the Windows Azure Mobile Service using the
// |readOnSuccess:onError:| method. |MSQuery| instances can be modfied and
// reused, but are not threadsafe.
@interface MSQuery : NSObject


#pragma mark * Public Readonly Properties


// The table associated with this query.
@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly)         MSTable *table;


#pragma mark * Public ReadWrite Properties


// The maximum number of items to return from the query.
@property (nonatomic) NSUInteger fetchLimit;

// The offset from the initial item to use when returning items from a query.
// Can be used with |fetchLimit| to implement paging.
@property (nonatomic) NSUInteger fetchOffset;

// Indicates if the Windows Azure Mobile Service should also include the total
// count of items on the server (not just the count of items returned) with
// the query results.
@property (nonatomic) BOOL includeTotalCount;

// A dictionary of string key-value pairs that can include user-defined
// parameters to use with the query.
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSDictionary *parameters;

// The fields or keys of an item that should be included in the results. A
// value of "*" means all fields should be included. "*" is the default value
// if no select keys are specified.
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSArray *selectFields;


#pragma mark * Public Initializer Methods


// Initializes a |MSQuery| instance with the given table.
-(id)initWithTable:(MSTable *)table;

// Returns a new |MSQuery| instance with the given table and the given
// predicate is used as the filter clause of the query.
-(id)initWithTable:(MSTable *)table predicate:(NSPredicate *)predicate;


#pragma mark * Public OrderBy Methods


// Indicates that the query results should be returned in ascending order
// based on the given field. |orderByAscending:| and |orderByDescending:| can
// each be called multiple times to further specify how the query results
// should be ordered.
-(void)orderByAscending:(NSString *)field;

// Indicates that the query results should be returned in descending order
// based on the given field. |orderByAscending:| and |orderByDescending:| can
// each be called multiple times to further specify how the query results
// should be ordered.
-(void)orderByDescending:(NSString *)field;


#pragma mark * Public Read Methods


// Executes the query by sending a request to the Windows Azure Mobile Service.
-(void) readWithCompletion:(MSReadQueryBlock)completion;


#pragma mark * Public QueryString Methods


// Generates a query string for current state of the |MSQuery| instance or an
// error if the query string could not be generated.
-(NSString *)queryStringOrError:(NSError **)error;
