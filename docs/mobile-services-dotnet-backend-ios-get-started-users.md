# Add Authentication to Existing Azure Mobile Services app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-get-started-users](../../includes/mobile-services-selector-get-started-users.md)]

&nbsp;

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-service-note-mobile-apps](../../includes/mobile-services-note-mobile-apps.md)]
> For the equivalent Mobile Apps version of this topic, see [Add authentication to your iOS app](../app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-ios-get-started-users.md).

In this tutorial, you add authentication to the Quick Start project using a supported identity provider. This tutorial is based on the [Mobile Services Quick Start tutorial], which you must complete first.

##<a name="register"></a>Register app for authentication and configure Mobile Services

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-register-authentication](../../includes/mobile-services-register-authentication.md)]

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-aad-server-extension](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-aad-server-extension.md)]

##<a name="permissions"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend](../../includes/mobile-services-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend.md)]

In Xcode, open the project. Press the **Run** button to  start the app. Verify that an exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts. This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the _TodoItem_ table now requires authentication.

##<a name="add-authentication"></a>Add authentication to app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-ios-authenticate-app](../../includes/mobile-services-ios-authenticate-app.md)]

##<a name="store-authentication"></a>Store authentication tokens in app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-ios-authenticate-app-with-token](../../includes/mobile-services-ios-authenticate-app-with-token.md)]

##<a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps

In the next tutorial, [Service-side authorization of Mobile Services users], you will user the user ID value to filter returned data.
