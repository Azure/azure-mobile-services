# Get started with authentication in Mobile Services

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-get-started-users](../../includes/mobile-services-selector-get-started-users.md)]

&nbsp;

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-service-note-mobile-apps](../../includes/mobile-services-note-mobile-apps.md)]
> For the equivalent Mobile Apps version of this topic, see [Add authentication to your Xamarin.Android app](../app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-get-started-users.md).

This topic shows you how to authenticate users in Azure Mobile Services from your app. In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by Mobile Services. After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable authentication in your app:

1. [Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services]
2. [Restrict table permissions to authenticated users]
3. [Add authentication to the app]

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services].

##<a name="register"></a>Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-register-authentication](../../includes/mobile-services-register-authentication.md)]

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-aad-server-extension](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-aad-server-extension.md)]

##<a name="permissions"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend](../../includes/mobile-services-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend.md)]

<ol start="6">
<li><p>In Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio, run the client project on a device or simulator. Verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts.</p>
   	<p>This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the <em>TodoItem</em> table now requires authentication.</p></li>
</ol>

Next, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the mobile service.

##<a name="add-authentication"></a>Add authentication to the app

1. Add the following property to the **TodoActivity** class:

			private MobileServiceUser user;

2. Add the following method to the **TodoActivity** class:

	        private async Task Authenticate()
	        {
	            try
	            {
	                user = await client.LoginAsync(this, MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Facebook);
	                CreateAndShowDialog(string.Format("you are now logged in - {0}", user.UserId), "Logged in!");
	            }
	            catch (Exception ex)
	            {
	                CreateAndShowDialog(ex, "Authentication failed");
	            }
	        }

    This creates a new method to handle the authentication process. The user is authenticated by using a Facebook login. A dialog is displayed which displays the ID of the authenticated user.

    > [AZURE.NOTE] If you are using an identity provider other than a Facebook, change the value passed to **LoginAsync** above to one of the following: _MicrosoftAccount_, _Twitter_, _Google_, or _WindowsAzureActiveDirectory_.

3. In the **OnCreate** method, add the following line of code after the code that instantiates the `MobileServiceClient` object.

		await Authenticate(); // add this line

	This call starts the authentication process and awaits it asynchronously.


4. From the **Run** menu, click **Start debugging** to start the app and sign in with your chosen identity provider.

   	When you are successfully logged-in, the app should run without errors, and you should be able to query Mobile Services and make updates to data.

In the next tutorial, [Service-side authorization of Mobile Services users][Authorize users with scripts], you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services.
