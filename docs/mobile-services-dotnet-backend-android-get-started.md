> For the equivalent Mobile Apps version of this topic, see [Create an Android app in Azure Mobile Apps](../app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-android-get-started.md).

This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to an Android app using Azure Mobile Services. In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple _To do list_ app that stores app data in the new mobile service. The mobile service that you will create uses the supported .NET languages using Visual Studio for server-side business logic and to manage the mobile service. To create a mobile service that lets you write your server-side business logic in JavaScript, see the [JavaScript backend version](mobile-services-android-get-started.md) of this topic.

A screenshot from the completed app is below:

Completing this tutorial requires the [Android Developer Tools][Android Studio], which includes the Android Studio integrated development environment, and the latest Android platform. Android 4.2 or a later version is required.

The downloaded quickstart project contains the Mobile Services SDK for Android.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for an Azure trial and get up to 10 free mobile services that you can keep using even after your trial ends. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=AE564AB28).


## <a name="create-new-service"> </a>Create a new mobile service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-create-new-service](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-create-new-service.md)]

## Download the mobile service to your local computer

Now that you have created the mobile service, download your personalized mobile service project that you can run on your local computer or virtual machine.

1. Click the mobile service that you just created, then in the quickstart tab, click **Android** under **Choose platform** and expand **Create a new Android app**.

	![][1]

2. If you haven't already done so, download and install [Visual Studio Professional 2013](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=391934), or a later version.

3. In Step 2, click **Download** under **Download and publish your service to the cloud**.

	This downloads the Visual Studio project that implements your mobile service. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you saved it.

## Test the mobile service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service.md)]

## Publish your mobile service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service.md)]

## Create a new Android app

In this section you will create a new Android app that is connected to your mobile service.

1. In the [Azure classic portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.

2. In the quickstart tab, click **Android** under **Choose platform** and expand **Create a new Android app**.

	![][2]

3. If you haven't already done so, download and install the [Android Developer Tools][Android SDK] on your local computer or virtual machine.

4. Under **Download and run your app**, click **Download**.

  	This downloads the project for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you save it.

## Run your Android app
