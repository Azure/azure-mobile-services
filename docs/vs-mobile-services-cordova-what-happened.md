# What happened to my Azure Cordova project after adding Azure Mobile Services by using Visual Studio Connected Services?

##References Added

The Azure Mobile Service Client plugin included with all Multi-Device Hybrid Apps has been enabled.
  
##Connection string values for Mobile Services

Under `services\mobileServices\settings`, a new JavaScript (.js) file with a **MobileServiceClient** was generated containing the selected mobile serviceâ€™s application URL and application key. The file contains the initialization of a mobile service client object, similar to the following code.

	var mobileServiceClient;
	document.addEventListener("deviceready", function() {
            mobileServiceClient = new WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient(
	        "<your mobile service name>.azure-mobile.net",
	        "<insert your key>"
	    );
