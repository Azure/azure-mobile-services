> For the equivalent Mobile Apps version of this topic, see [Create a Windows app with Mobile Apps](../app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-windows-store-dotnet-get-started.md).

This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to a universal Windows app using Azure Mobile Services. Universal Windows app solutions include projects for both Windows Store 8.1 and Windows Phone Store 8.1 apps and a common shared project. For more information, see [Build universal Windows apps that target Windows and Windows Phone](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/dn609832.aspx).

In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple *To do list* app that stores app data in the new mobile service. The mobile service that you will create uses the supported .NET languages using Visual Studio for server-side business logic and to manage the mobile service. To create a mobile service that lets you write your server-side business logic in JavaScript, see the JavaScript backend version of this topic.

>[AZURE.NOTE]This topic shows you how to create a new mobile service project and universal Windows app by using the Azure classic portal. By using Visual Studio 2013 Update 3, you can also add a new mobile service project to an existing Visual Studio solution. For more information, see [Add Mobile Services to an existing app](mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-universal-dotnet-get-started-data.md).

>To add a mobile service to an Windows Phone 8.0 or Windows Phone Silverlight 8.1 app project, see [Add Mobile Services to an existing Windows Phone app](mobile-services-windows-phone-get-started-data.md).

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-universal-get-started](../../includes/mobile-services-windows-universal-get-started.md)]

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* An active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for an Azure trial and get up to 10 free mobile services that you can keep using even after your trial ends. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A0E0E5C02&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdocumentation%2Farticles%2Fmobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-dotnet-get-started%2F).
* [Visual Studio 2013].

## Create a new mobile service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-create-new-service](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-create-new-service.md)]

## Create a new universal Windows app

Once you have created your mobile service, you can follow an easy quickstart in the Azure classic portal to either create a new app or modify an existing app to connect to your mobile service.

In this section you will create a new universal Windows app that is connected to your mobile service.

1. In the [Azure classic portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.

2. In the quickstart tab, click **Windows** under **Choose platform** and expand **Create a new Windows Store app**.

   	This displays the three easy steps to create a Windows Store app connected to your mobile service.

  	![Mobile Services quickstart steps](./media/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-dotnet-get-started/mobile-quickstart-steps.png)

3. If you haven't already done so, download and install [Visual Studio 2013] on your local computer or virtual machine.

4. Under **Download and run your app and service locally**, select a language for your Windows Store app, then click **Download**.

  	This downloads a solution contains projects for both the mobile service and for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you save it.

## Test the app against the local mobile service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service-dotnet](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service-dotnet.md)]

>[AZURE.NOTE]You can review the code that accesses your mobile service to query and insert data, which is found in the MainPage.xaml.cs file.


## Publish your mobile service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service.md)]


<ol start="4">
<li><p>In the Shared code project, open the App.xaml.cs file, locate the code that creates a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Windowsazure/microsoft.windowsazure.mobileservices.mobileserviceclient.aspx" target="_blank">MobileServiceClient</a> instance, comment-out the code that creates this client using <em>localhost</em> and uncomment the code that creates the client using the remote mobile service URL, which looks like the following:</p>

        <pre><code>public static MobileServiceClient MobileService = new MobileServiceClient(
            "https://todolist.azure-mobile.net/",
            "XXXX-APPLICATION-KEY-XXXXX");</code></pre>

	<p>The client will now access the mobile service published to Azure.</p></li>
</ol>

## Test the app against the mobile service hosted in Azure

Now that the mobile service is published and the client is connected to the remote mobile service hosted in Azure, we can run the app using Azure for item storage.
