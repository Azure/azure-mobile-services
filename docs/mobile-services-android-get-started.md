## Prerequisites

Completing this tutorial requires the [Android Developer Tools](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html), which includes the Android Studio integrated development environment, and the latest Android platform. Android 4.2 or a later version is required.

The downloaded quickstart project contains the Azure Mobile Services SDK for Android.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=AE564AB28).


## Create a new mobile service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service](../../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service.md)]

## Create a new Android app

Once you have created your mobile service, you can follow an easy quickstart in the Azure classic portal to either create a new app or modify an existing app to connect to your mobile service.

In this section you will create a new Android app that is connected to your mobile service.

1.  In the Azure classic portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.

2. In the quickstart tab, click **Android** under **Choose platform** and expand **Create a new Android app**.
