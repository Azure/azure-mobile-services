## Overview

This topic shows you how to authenticate users in Azure Mobile Services from your universal Windows app. In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by Mobile Services. After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Add Mobile Services to an existing app](mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-universal-dotnet-get-started-data.md).

>[AZURE.NOTE]This tutorial shows you how to use server-directed authentication for users in Windows Store and Windows Phone Store 8.1 apps. Fore information about client-directed authentication, see [Logging in with Google, Microsoft and Facebook SDKs to Azure Mobile Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/10/27/logging-in-with-google-microsoft-and-facebook-sdks-to-azure-mobile-services/).

##<a name="register"></a>Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services


1. In the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), click **Mobile Services** > your mobile service > **Dashboard**, and make a note of the **Mobile Service URL** value.

2. Register your app with one or more of the following authentication providers:
   * [Google](./
mobile-services-how-to-register-google-authentication.md)
   * [Facebook](./
mobile-services-how-to-register-facebook-authentication.md)
   * [Twitter](./
mobile-services-how-to-register-twitter-authentication.md)
   * [Microsoft](./
mobile-services-how-to-register-microsoft-authentication.md)
   * [Azure Active Directory](./
mobile-services-how-to-register-active-directory-authentication.md). 
   
    Make a note of the client identity and client secret values generated by the provider. Do not distribute or share the client secret.

3. Back in the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), click **Mobile Services** > your mobile service > **Identity** > your identity provider settings, then enter the client ID and secret value from your provider. 
 
You've now configured both your app and your mobile service to work with your auth provider. You may optionally repeat all these steps for each additional identity provider you'd like to support.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Verify that you've set the correct redirect URI on your identity provider's developer site. As described in the linked instructions for each provider above, the redirect URI may be different for a .NET backend service vs. for a JavaScript backend service. An incorrectly configured redirect URI may result in the login screen not being displayed properly and the app malfunctioning in unexpected ways.


### (Optional) Configure your .NET Mobile Service for Azure Active Directory

>[AZURE.NOTE] These steps are optional because they only apply to the Azure Active Directory login provider.

1. Install the [WindowsAzure.MobileServices.Backend.Security NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.MobileServices.Backend.Security).

2. In Visual Studio expand App_Start and open WebApiConfig.cs. Add the following `using` statement at the top:

        using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Mobile.Service.Security.Providers;

3. Also in WebApiConfig.cs, add the following code to the `Register` method, immediately after `options` is instantiated:

        options.LoginProviders.Remove(typeof(AzureActiveDirectoryLoginProvider));
        options.LoginProviders.Add(typeof(AzureActiveDirectoryExtendedLoginProvider));

##<a name="permissions"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users



By default, all requests to mobile service resources are restricted to clients that present the application key, which does not strictly secure access to resources. To secure your resources, you must restrict access to only authenticated clients.

1. In Visual Studio, open your mobile service project, expand the Controllers folder, and open **TodoItemController.cs**. The **TodoItemController** class implements data access for the TodoItem table. Add the following `using` statement:

		using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Mobile.Service.Security;

2. Apply the following _AuthorizeLevel_ attribute to the **TodoItemController** class. 

		[AuthorizeLevel(AuthorizationLevel.User)]

	This makes sure that all operations against the _TodoItem_ table require an authenticated user. You can also apply the *AuthorizeLevel* attribute at the method level.

3. (Optional) If you wish to debug authentication locally, expand the `App_Start` folder, open **WebApiConfig.cs**, and add the following code to the **Register** method.  

		config.SetIsHosted(true);

	This tells the local mobile service project to run as if it is being hosted in Azure, including honoring the *AuthorizeLevel* settings. Without this setting, all HTTP requests to localhost are permitted without authentication despite the *AuthorizeLevel* setting. When you enable self-hosted mode, you also need to set a value for the local application key.

4. (Optional) In the web.config project file, set a string value for the `MS_ApplicationKey` app setting. 

	This is the password that you use (with no username) to test the API help pages when you run the service locally.  This string value is not used by the live site in Azure, and you do not need to use the actual application key; any valid string value will work.
 
4. Republish your project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;6. In Visual Studio, right-click the Windows Store project for the TodoList app and click **Set as StartUp Project**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;7. In the shared project, open the App.xaml.cs project file, locate the definition for the [MobileServiceClient](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/microsoft.windowsazure.mobileservices.mobileserviceclient.aspx), and make sure that it is configured to connect to the mobile service running in Azure.

>[AZURE.NOTE]When you use Visual Studio tools to connect your app to a Mobile Service, the tool generate two sets of **MobileServiceClient** definitions, one for each client platform. This is a good time to simplify the generated code by unifying the `#if...#endif` wrapped **MobileServiceClient** definitions into a single unwrapped definition used by both versions of the app. You won't need to do this when you downloaded the quickstart app from the [Azure classic portal].

&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Press the F5 key to run the Windows store app, and verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the *TodoItem* table now requires authentication.

Next, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the mobile service.

##<a name="add-authentication"></a>Add authentication to the app


##Install the storage client in the mobile service project

To be able to generate an SAS to upload images to Blob storage, you must first add the NuGet package that installs Storage client library in the mobile service project. 

1. In **Solution Explorer** in Visual Studio, right-click the mobile service project, and then select **Manage NuGet Packages**.

2. In the left pane, select the **Online** category, select **Stabile Only**, search for **WindowsAzure.Storage**, click **Install** on the **Azure Storage** package, then accept the license agreements. 

  	![](./media/mobile-services-configure-blob-storage/mobile-add-storage-nuget-package-dotnet.png)

  	This adds the client library for Azure storage services to the mobile service project.


1. Open the shared project file MainPage.cs and add the following code snippet to the MainPage class:
	
		// Define a member variable for storing the signed-in user. 
        private MobileServiceUser user;

        // Define a method that performs the authentication process
        // using a Facebook sign-in. 
        private async System.Threading.Tasks.Task<bool> AuthenticateAsync()
        {
            string message;
            bool success = false;
            try
            {
                // Change 'MobileService' to the name of your MobileServiceClient instance.
                // Sign-in using Facebook authentication.
                user = await App.MobileService
                    .LoginAsync(MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Facebook);
                message =
                    string.Format("You are now signed in - {0}", user.UserId);

                success = true;
            }
            catch (InvalidOperationException)
            {
                message = "You must log in. Login Required";
            }

            var dialog = new MessageDialog(message);
            dialog.Commands.Add(new UICommand("OK"));
            await dialog.ShowAsync();
            return success;
        }

    This code authenticates the user with a Facebook login. If you are using an identity provider other than Facebook, change the value of **MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider** above to the value for your provider.

3. Comment-out or delete the call to the **RefreshTodoItems** method in the existing **OnNavigatedTo** method override.

	This prevents the data from being loaded before the user is authenticated. Next, you will add a **Sign in** button to the app that triggers authentication.

4. Add the following code snippet to the MainPage class:

        private async void ButtonLogin_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            // Login the user and then load data from the mobile app.
            if (await AuthenticateAsync())
            {
                // Hide the login button and load items from the mobile app.
                ButtonLogin.Visibility = Windows.UI.Xaml.Visibility.Collapsed;
                //await InitLocalStoreAsync(); //offline sync support.
                await RefreshTodoItems();
            }
        }
		
5. In the Windows Store app project, open the MainPage.xaml project file and add the following **Button** element just before the element that defines the **Save** button:

		<Button Name="ButtonLogin" Click="ButtonLogin_Click" 
                        Visibility="Visible">Sign in</Button>

6. In the Windows Phone Store app project, add the following **Button** element in the **ContentPanel**, after the **TextBox** element:

        <Button Grid.Row ="1" Grid.Column="1" Name="ButtonLogin" Click="ButtonLogin_Click" 
        	Margin="10, 0, 0, 0" Visibility="Visible">Sign in</Button>

8. Open the shared App.xaml.cs project file and add the following code:

        protected override void OnActivated(IActivatedEventArgs args)
        {
			// Windows Phone 8.1 requires you to handle the respose from the WebAuthenticationBroker.
            #if WINDOWS_PHONE_APP
            if (args.Kind == ActivationKind.WebAuthenticationBrokerContinuation)
            {
				// Completes the sign-in process started by LoginAsync.
				// Change 'MobileService' to the name of your MobileServiceClient instance. 
                App.MobileService.LoginComplete(args as WebAuthenticationBrokerContinuationEventArgs);
            }
            #endif

            base.OnActivated(args);
        }

	If the **OnActivated** method already exists, just add the `#if...#endif` code block.

9. Press the F5 key to run the Windows Store app, click the **Sign in** button, and sign into the app with your chosen identity provider. 

   	When you are successfully logged-in, the app should run without errors, and you should be able to query your backend and make updates to data.

10. Right-click the Windows Phone Store app project, click **Set as StartUp Project**, then repeat the previous step to verify that the Windows Phone Store app also runs correctly.  

 

>[AZURE.NOTE]If you registered your Windows Store app package information with Mobile Services, you should call the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=311594" target="_blank">LoginAsync</a> method by supplying a value of **true** for the *useSingleSignOn* parameter. If you do not do this, your users will continue to be presented with a login prompt every time that the login method is called.

##<a name="tokens"></a>Store the authorization tokens on the client

The previous example showed a standard sign-in, which requires the client to contact both the identity provider and the mobile service every time that the app starts. Not only is this method inefficient, you can run into usage-related issues should many customers try to start your app at the same time. A better approach is to cache the authorization token returned by Mobile Services and try to use this first before using a provider-based sign-in.

>[AZURE.NOTE]You can cache the token issued by Mobile Services regardless of whether you are using client-managed or service-managed authentication. This tutorial uses service-managed authentication.


1. In the MainPage.xaml.cs project file, add the following **using** statements:

		using System.Linq;		
		using Windows.Security.Credentials;

2. Replace the **AuthenticateAsync** method with the following code:

        private async System.Threading.Tasks.Task<bool> AuthenticateAsync()
        {
            string message;
            bool success = false;

            // This sample uses the Facebook provider.
            var provider = MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Facebook;

            // Use the PasswordVault to securely store and access credentials.
            PasswordVault vault = new PasswordVault();
            PasswordCredential credential = null;

            try
            {
                // Try to get an existing credential from the vault.
                credential = vault.FindAllByResource(provider.ToString()).FirstOrDefault();
            }
            catch (Exception)
            {
                // When there is no matching resource an error occurs, which we ignore.
            }

            if (credential != null)
            {
                // Create a user from the stored credentials.
                user = new MobileServiceUser(credential.UserName);
                credential.RetrievePassword();
                user.MobileServiceAuthenticationToken = credential.Password;

                // Set the user from the stored credentials.
                App.MobileService.CurrentUser = user;

                // Consider adding a check to determine if the token is 
                // expired, as shown in this post: http://aka.ms/jww5vp.

                success = true;
                message = string.Format("Cached credentials for user - {0}", user.UserId);
            }
            else
            {
                try
                {
                    // Login with the identity provider.
                    user = await App.MobileService
                        .LoginAsync(provider);

                    // Create and store the user credentials.
                    credential = new PasswordCredential(provider.ToString(),
                        user.UserId, user.MobileServiceAuthenticationToken);
                    vault.Add(credential);

                    success = true;
                    message = string.Format("You are now logged in - {0}", user.UserId);
                }
                catch (MobileServiceInvalidOperationException)
                {
                    message = "You must log in. Login Required";
                }
            }
            
            var dialog = new MessageDialog(message);
            dialog.Commands.Add(new UICommand("OK"));
            await dialog.ShowAsync();

            return success;
        }

	In this version of **AuthenticateAsync**, the app tries to use credentials stored in the **PasswordVault** to access the service. A regular sign-in is also performed when there is no stored credential.

	>[AZURE.NOTE]A cached token may be expired, and token expiration can also occur after authentication when the app is in use. To learn how to determine if a token is expired, see [Check for expired authentication tokens](http://aka.ms/jww5vp). For a solution to handling authorization errors related to expiring tokens, see the post [Caching and handling expired tokens in Azure Mobile Services managed SDK](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/carlosfigueira/archive/2014/03/13/caching-and-handling-expired-tokens-in-azure-mobile-services-managed-sdk.aspx). 

3. Restart the app twice.

	Notice that on the first start-up, sign-in with the provider is again required. However, on the second restart the cached credentials are used and sign-in is bypassed.
