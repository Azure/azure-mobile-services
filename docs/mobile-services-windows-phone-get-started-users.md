# Add authentication to your Mobile Services app

>[AZURE.WARNING] This is an **Azure Mobile Services** topic.  This service has been superseded by Azure App Service Mobile Apps and is scheduled for removal from Azure.  We recommend using Azure Mobile Apps for all new mobile backend deployments.  Read [this announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/transition-of-azure-mobile-services/) to learn more about the pending deprecation of this service.

##Overview

This topic shows you how to authenticate users in Azure Mobile Services from your app. In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by Mobile Services. After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.

This tutorial is also demonstrated by Nick Harris in the following video:

> [AZURE.VIDEO mobile-authorize-users-in-scripts-windows-phone]

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Add Mobile Services to an existing app].

>[AZURE.NOTE]This tutorial demonstrates the authentication flow managed by Mobile Services using a variety of identity providers. This method is easy to configure and supports multiple providers. By using client-managed authentication, your app has access to additional user data maintained by the identity provider. You can get the same user data in your mobile service by by calling the **user.getIdentities()** function in server scripts. For more information, see [this post](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=506605).

##<a name="register"></a>Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services


1. In the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), click **Mobile Services** > your mobile service > **Dashboard**, and make a note of the **Mobile Service URL** value.

2. Register your app with one or more of the following authentication providers:
   * [Google](../articles/mobile-services/mobile-services-how-to-register-google-authentication.md)
   * [Facebook](../articles/mobile-services/mobile-services-how-to-register-facebook-authentication.md)
   * [Twitter](../articles/mobile-services/mobile-services-how-to-register-twitter-authentication.md)
   * [Microsoft](../articles/mobile-services/mobile-services-how-to-register-microsoft-authentication.md)
   * [Azure Active Directory](../articles/mobile-services/mobile-services-how-to-register-active-directory-authentication.md). 
   
    Make a note of the client identity and client secret values generated by the provider. Do not distribute or share the client secret.

3. Back in the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), click **Mobile Services** > your mobile service > **Identity** > your identity provider settings, then enter the client ID and secret value from your provider. 
 
You've now configured both your app and your mobile service to work with your auth provider. You may optionally repeat all these steps for each additional identity provider you'd like to support.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Verify that you've set the correct redirect URI on your identity provider's developer site. As described in the linked instructions for each provider above, the redirect URI may be different for a .NET backend service vs. for a JavaScript backend service. An incorrectly configured redirect URI may result in the login screen not being displayed properly and the app malfunctioning in unexpected ways.


##<a name="permissions"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users


To secure your endpoints, you must restrict access to only authenticated clients. 

1. In the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), navigate to your mobile service, then click  **Data** > your table name (**TodoItem**) > **Permissions**. 

2. Set all of the table operation permissions to **Only authenticated users**. 

	 This ensures that all operations against the table require an authenticated user, which is required for this tutorial. You can set different permissions on each operations to support your specific scenario.  


&nbsp;&nbsp;3. In Visual Studio, open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Add Mobile Services to an existing app](mobile-services-windows-phone-get-started-data.md).

&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Press the F5 key to run this quickstart-based app; verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts. This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the *TodoItem* table now requires authentication.

Next, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the mobile service.

##<a name="add-authentication"></a>Add authentication to the app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-phone-authenticate-app](../../includes/mobile-services-windows-phone-authenticate-app.md)]

##<a name="tokens"></a>Store the authorization tokens on the client

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-phone-authenticate-app-with-token](../../includes/mobile-services-windows-phone-authenticate-app-with-token.md)]

## <a name="next-steps"> </a>Next steps

In the next tutorial, [Service-side authorization of Mobile Services users](mobile-services-javascript-backend-service-side-authorization.md), you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services.
