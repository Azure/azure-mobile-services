# Add authentication to your universal Windows 8.1 app

>[AZURE.WARNING] This is an **Azure Mobile Services** topic.  This service has been superseded by Azure App Service Mobile Apps and is scheduled for removal from Azure.  We recommend using Azure Mobile Apps for all new mobile backend deployments.  Read [this announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/transition-of-azure-mobile-services/) to learn more about the pending deprecation of this service.

This topic shows you how to authenticate users in Azure Mobile Services from your universal Windows 8.1 app. In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by Mobile Services. After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

>[AZURE.NOTE]This tutorial shows you how to authenticate users in Windows Store and Windows Phone Store 8.1 apps. For a Windows Phone 8.0 or Windows Phone Silverlight 8.1 app, see this version of [Get started with authentication in Mobile Services](mobile-services-windows-phone-get-started-users.md).

##<a name="register"></a> Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-register-authentication](../../includes/mobile-services-register-authentication.md)] 

##<a name="permissions"></a> Restrict permissions to authenticated users

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-restrict-permissions-windows](../../includes/mobile-services-restrict-permissions-windows.md)] 
 
>[AZURE.NOTE] When you use Visual Studio tools to connect your app to a Mobile Service, the tool generate two sets of **MobileServiceClient** definitions, one for each client platform. This is a good time to simplify the generated code by unifying the `#if...#endif` wrapped **MobileServiceClient** definitions into a single unwrapped definition used by both versions of the app. You won't need to do this if you downloaded the quickstart app from the [Azure classic portal].

##<a name="add-authentication"></a> Add authentication to the app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-windows-universal-dotnet-authenticate-app](../../includes/mobile-windows-universal-dotnet-authenticate-app.md)] 

Now, any user authenticated by your trusted identity providers can access the *TodoItem* table. To better secure user-specific data, you must also implement authorization. To do this you get the user ID of a given user, which can then be used to determine what level of access that user should have for a given resource.

##<a name="tokens"></a>Store the authorization token on the client

The previous example showed a standard sign-in, which requires the client to contact both the identity provider and the mobile service every time that the app starts. Not only is this method inefficient, you can run into usage-related issues should many customers try to start your app at the same time. A better approach is to cache the authorization token returned by Mobile Services and try to use this first before using a provider-based sign-in. 

>[AZURE.NOTE]You can cache the token issued by Mobile Services regardless of whether you are using client-managed or service-managed authentication. This tutorial uses service-managed authentication.

## <a name="next-steps"> </a>Next steps

In the next tutorial, [Service-side authorization of Mobile Services users](mobile-services-javascript-backend-service-side-authorization.md), you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services.
