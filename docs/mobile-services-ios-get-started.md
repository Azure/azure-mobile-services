>[AZURE.WARNING] This is an **Azure Mobile Services** topic.  This service has been superseded by Azure App Service Mobile Apps and is scheduled for removal from Azure.  We recommend using Azure Mobile Apps for all new mobile backend deployments.  Read [this announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/transition-of-azure-mobile-services/) to learn more about the pending deprecation of this service.

This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to an iOS app using Azure Mobile Services.

In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple _To do list_ app that stores app data in the new mobile service. The mobile service that you will create uses JavaScript for server-side business logic. To create a mobile service with server-side business logic in .NET, see the [.NET backend version] of this topic.

> [AZURE.NOTE] To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for an Azure trial and get [free mobile services that you can keep using even after your trial ends](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/mobile-services/). For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=AE564AB28&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdevelop%2Fmobile%2Ftutorials%2Fget-started-ios%2F%20).

## Create a new iOS app

You can follow an easy Quick Start in the Azure classic portal to create a new app connected to your mobile service:

1. In the [Azure classic portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.

2. In the Quick Start tab, click **iOS** under **Choose a platform** and expand **Create a new iOS app**. This displays the steps to create an iOS app connected to your mobile service.

3. Click **Create TodoItem table** to create a table to store app data.

4. Under **Download and run your app**, click **Download**. This downloads the project for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service, along with the Mobile Services iOS SDK. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you saved it.

## Run your new iOS app

<li><p>Back in the [Azure classic portal], click the **DATA** tab and then click the **TodoItem** table. This lets you browse the data inserted by the app into the table.<p></li></ol></p>
