This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to a Xamarin.Android app using Azure Mobile Services. In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple *To do list* app that stores app data in the new mobile service.

If you prefer to watch a video, the clip below follows the same steps on this tutorial.

A screenshot from the completed app is below:

Completing this tutorial requires XCode and Xamarin Studio for OS X or Visual Studio on Windows with a networked Mac. Complete installation instructions are on [Setup and Install for Visual Studio and Xamarin](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt613162.aspx). 

The downloaded quickstart project contains the Azure Mobile services component for Xamarin.Android. While this project targets Android 4.2 or a later version, the Mobile Services SDK requires only Android 2.2 or a later version.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for an Azure trial and get up to 10 free mobile services that you can keep using even after your trial ends. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A9C9624B5).

## Create a new Xamarin.Android app

Once you have created your mobile service, you can follow an easy quickstart in the Azure classic portal to either create a new app or modify an existing app to connect to your mobile service.

In this section you will create a new Xamarin.Android app that is connected to your mobile service.

1.  In the [Azure classic portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.

2. In the quickstart tab, click **Xamarin.Android** under **Choose platform** and expand **Create a new Android app**.

	![][6]

	This displays the three easy steps to create a Xamarin.Android app connected to your mobile service.

	![][7]

3. Click **Create TodoItem table** to create a table to store app data.

4. Under **Download and run app**, click **Download**.

	This downloads the project for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you save it.

## Run your Android app

The final stage of this tutorial is to build and run your new app.

1. Browse to the location where you saved the compressed project files and expand the files on your computer.

2. In Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio, click **File** then **Open**, navigate to the uncompressed sample files, and select **XamarinTodoQuickStart.Android.sln** to open it.

3. Press the **Run** button to build the project and start the app. You will be asked to select an emulator or a connected USB device.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] To be able to run the project in the Android emulator, you must define at least one Android Virtual Device (AVD). Use the AVD Manager to create and manage these devices.

4. In the app, type meaningful text, such as _Complete the tutorial_, and then click **Add**.

	![][10]

	This sends a POST request to the new mobile service hosted in Azure. Data from the request is inserted into the TodoItem table. Items stored in the table are returned by the mobile service, and the data is displayed in the list.

	> [AZURE.NOTE]
   	> You can review the code that accesses your mobile service to query and insert data, which is found in the ToDoActivity.cs C# file.

6. Back in the [Azure classic portal], click the **Data** tab and then click the **TodoItems** table.

	![][11]

	This lets you browse the data inserted by the app into the table.
