This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to an iOS app using Azure Mobile Services. In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple _To do list_ app that stores app data in the new mobile service. The mobile service uses .NET and Visual Studio for server-side business logic. To create a mobile service with server-side business logic in JavaScript, see the [JavaScript backend version] of this topic.

> [AZURE.NOTE] To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for an Azure trial and get [free mobile services that you can keep using even after your trial ends](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/mobile-services/).  For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=AE564AB28&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fdocumentation%2Farticles%2Fmobile-services-dotnet-backend-ios-get-started%2F).

## Download the mobile service and app to your local computer

Now that you have created the mobile service, download projects that you can run locally.

1. Click the mobile service that you just created, then in the Quick Start tab, click **iOS** under **Choose a platform** and expand **Create a new iOS app**.

2. On your Windows PC, click **Download** under **Download and publish your service to the cloud**. This downloads the Visual Studio project that implements your mobile service. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you saved it.

3. On your Mac, click **Download** under **Download and run your app**. This downloads the project for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service, along with the Mobile Services iOS SDK. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you saved it.

## Test the mobile service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service.md)]

## Publish your mobile service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service](../../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service.md)]


## Run your new iOS app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-ios-run-app](../../includes/mobile-services-ios-run-app.md)]

This shows how to run your new client app against the mobile service running in Azure. Before you can test the iOS app with the mobile service running on a local computer, you must configure the Web server and firewall to allow access from your iOS development computer. For more information, see [Configure the local web server to allow connections to a local mobile service](mobile-services-dotnet-backend-how-to-configure-iis-express.md).
