# What happens to my Javascript project when I add Azure Mobile Services using Connected Visual Studio Services?

## NuGet package added

The **WindowsAzure.MobileServices.WinJS** NuGet package was installed, including the Azure Mobile Service library in the `js\MobileServices.js` file.
  
## Connection string values for Mobile Services 

In the `services\mobileServices\settings` folder, a new JavaScript (.js) file with a **MobileServiceClient** was generated that contains the selected mobile service's application URL and application key.  

## References added to default.html

References to `MobileServices.js` and the settings file were added to `default.html`.  

## Connected services files added

In the services folder, Connected Services configuration files were added.
