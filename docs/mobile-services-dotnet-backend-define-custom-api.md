>[AZURE.WARNING] This is an **Azure Mobile Services** topic.  This service has been superseded by Azure App Service Mobile Apps and is scheduled for removal from Azure.  We recommend using Azure Mobile Apps for all new mobile backend deployments.  Read [this announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/transition-of-azure-mobile-services/) to learn more about the pending deprecation of this service.

> Learn about [migrating your site to Azure App Service](../articles/app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-migrating-from-mobile-services.md).
>
> Get started with Azure Mobile Apps, see the [Azure Mobile Apps documentation center](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/learning-paths/appservice-mobileapps/).
> For the equivalent Mobile Apps version of this topic, see [How to: Define a custom API controller](../app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md#how-to-define-a-custom-api-controller).

This topic shows you how to define a custom API endpoint in a .NET backend mobile service. A custom API lets you define custom endpoints with server functionality, but it does not map to a database insert, update, delete, or read operation. By using a custom API, you have more control over messaging, including HTTP headers and body format.

For information on how to invoke a custom API in your app using a Mobile Services client library, see [Call a custom API](mobile-services-windows-dotnet-how-to-use-client-library.md#custom-api) in the client SDK reference.
