This topic shows you how to register your apps to be able to use Twitter to authenticate with Azure Mobile Services.

>[AZURE.NOTE] This tutorial is about [Azure Mobile Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/mobile-services/), a solution to help you build scalable mobile applications for any platform. Mobile Services makes it easy to sync data, authenticate users, and send push notifications. This page supports the [Add authentication to your app](mobile-services-ios-get-started-users.md) tutorial which shows how to sign users into your app. If this is your first experience with Mobile Services, please complete the tutorial [Get Started with Mobile Services](mobile-services-ios-get-started.md).

To complete the procedure in this topic, you must have a Twitter account that has a verified email address. To create a new Twitter account, go to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=268287" target="_blank">twitter.com</a>.

1. Navigate to the [Twitter Developers](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268300) website, sign-in with your Twitter account credentials, and click **Create new app**.

2. Type the **Name**, **Description**, and **Website** values for your app, then type one of the following URL formats in **Callback URL**.

	+ **.NET backend**: `https://<mobile_service>.azure-mobile.net/signin-twitter`
	+ **JavaScript backend**: `https://<mobile_service>.azure-mobile.net/login/twitter`

	 >[AZURE.NOTE]Make sure that you use the correct redirect URL path format for your type of Mobile Services backend. When this is incorrect, authentication will not succeed.

3.  At the bottom the page, read and accept the terms, and then click **Create your Twitter application**.

   	This registers the app displays the application details.

6. Click the **Keys and Access Tokens** tab in your app dashboard and make a note of the values of **Consumer key** and **Consumer secret**.

    > [AZURE.NOTE] The consumer secret is an important security credential. Do not share this secret with anyone or distribute it with your app.

7. Click the **Settings** tab, scroll down and make sure the **Allow this application to be used to sign in with Twitter** checkbox is checked, then click **Update Settings**.

You are now ready to use a Twitter login for authentication in your app by providing the consumer key and consumer secret values to Mobile Services.
