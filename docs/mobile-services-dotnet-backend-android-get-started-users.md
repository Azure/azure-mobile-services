## Summary

This topic shows you how to authenticate users in Azure Mobile Services from your app. In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by Mobile Services. After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.

This tutorial walks you through the basic steps to enable authentication in your app.


## Prerequisites

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-prerequisites](../../includes/mobile-services-android-prerequisites.md)]

##<a name="register"></a>Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services


1. In the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), click **Mobile Services** > your mobile service > **Dashboard**, and make a note of the **Mobile Service URL** value.

2. Register your app with one or more of the following authentication providers:
   * [Google](../articles/mobile-services/mobile-services-how-to-register-google-authentication.md)
   * [Facebook](../articles/mobile-services/mobile-services-how-to-register-facebook-authentication.md)
   * [Twitter](../articles/mobile-services/mobile-services-how-to-register-twitter-authentication.md)
   * [Microsoft](../articles/mobile-services/mobile-services-how-to-register-microsoft-authentication.md)
   * [Azure Active Directory](../articles/mobile-services/mobile-services-how-to-register-active-directory-authentication.md). 
   
    Make a note of the client identity and client secret values generated by the provider. Do not distribute or share the client secret.

3. Back in the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), click **Mobile Services** > your mobile service > **Identity** > your identity provider settings, then enter the client ID and secret value from your provider. 
 
You've now configured both your app and your mobile service to work with your auth provider. You may optionally repeat all these steps for each additional identity provider you'd like to support.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Verify that you've set the correct redirect URI on your identity provider's developer site. As described in the linked instructions for each provider above, the redirect URI may be different for a .NET backend service vs. for a JavaScript backend service. An incorrectly configured redirect URI may result in the login screen not being displayed properly and the app malfunctioning in unexpected ways.

##<a name="permissions"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users



By default, all requests to mobile service resources are restricted to clients that present the application key, which does not strictly secure access to resources. To secure your resources, you must restrict access to only authenticated clients.

1. In Visual Studio, open your mobile service project, expand the Controllers folder, and open **TodoItemController.cs**. The **TodoItemController** class implements data access for the TodoItem table. Add the following `using` statement:

		using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Mobile.Service.Security;

2. Apply the following _AuthorizeLevel_ attribute to the **TodoItemController** class. 

		[AuthorizeLevel(AuthorizationLevel.User)]

	This makes sure that all operations against the _TodoItem_ table require an authenticated user. You can also apply the *AuthorizeLevel* attribute at the method level.

3. (Optional) If you wish to debug authentication locally, expand the `App_Start` folder, open **WebApiConfig.cs**, and add the following code to the **Register** method.  

		config.SetIsHosted(true);

	This tells the local mobile service project to run as if it is being hosted in Azure, including honoring the *AuthorizeLevel* settings. Without this setting, all HTTP requests to localhost are permitted without authentication despite the *AuthorizeLevel* setting. When you enable self-hosted mode, you also need to set a value for the local application key.

4. (Optional) In the web.config project file, set a string value for the `MS_ApplicationKey` app setting. 

	This is the password that you use (with no username) to test the API help pages when you run the service locally.  This string value is not used by the live site in Azure, and you do not need to use the actual application key; any valid string value will work.
 
4. Republish your project.

3. Open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services].

4. From the **Run** menu, then click **Run app** to start the app; verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts.

	 This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the _TodoItem_ table now requires authentication.

Next, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the mobile service.

##<a name="add-authentication"></a>Add authentication to the app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-android-authenticate-app](../../includes/mobile-android-authenticate-app.md)]

## <a name="cache-tokens"></a>Cache authentication tokens on the client

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-android-authenticate-app-with-token](../../includes/mobile-android-authenticate-app-with-token.md)]

## <a name="refresh-tokens"></a>Refresh the token cache

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-android-authenticate-app-refresh-token](../../includes/mobile-android-authenticate-app-refresh-token.md)]

##<a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps

In the next tutorial, [Service-side authorization of Mobile Services users][Authorize users with scripts], you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services.
